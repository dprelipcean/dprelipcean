- 👋 Hi, I’m @dprelipcean, Doctoral Student at CERN and TUM.
- 👀 I’m interested in High Energy Physics and Radiation to Electronics, mainly via software tools like Monte Carlo Simulations.
- 👀 I'm of the opinion that the journey matters, and hence, Open Reproducible Research!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning (ironic, no?) and Data Analysis packages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making Academica Research open and available to all.
- 📫 How to reach me daniel.prelipcean@cern.ch
