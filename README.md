- 👋 Hi, I’m @dprelipcean, Doctoral Student at CERN and TUM.
- 👀 I’m interested in High Energy Physics and Radiation to Electronics, mainly via software tools like Monte Carlo Simulations.
- 👀 I'm of the opinion that the journey matters, and hence, Open Reproducible Research!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making Academica Research open and available to all.
- 📫 More about me on [my website](https://dprelipcean.github.io/personal-website/)
